      <p>Abstract: Applications like high-energy physics and cybersecurity require extremely high throughput and low latency neural network (NN) inference. Lookup-table-based NNs address these constraints by implementing NNs as lookup tables (LUTs), achieving inference latency on the order of nanoseconds. Since LUTs are a fundamental FPGA building block, LUT-based NNs efficiently map to FPGAs. LogicNets (and its successors) form one class of LUT-based NNs that target FPGAs, mapping neurons directly to LUTs to meet low latency constraints with minimal resources. However, it is difficult to build larger, more performant LUT-based NNs like LogicNets because LUT usage increases exponentially with respect to neuron fan-in (i.e., number of synapses * synapse bitwidth). A large LUT-based NN quickly runs out of LUTs on an FPGA. Our work AmigoLUT addresses this issue by creating ensembles of smaller LUT-based NNs that scale linearly with respect to the number of models. AmigoLUT improves the scalability of LUT-based NNs, reaching higher throughput with up to an order of magnitude fewer LUTs than the largest LUT-based NNs.</p>

[<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13321">PDF</a>]</p>
      <p>Abstract: Modern machine learning often relies on optimizing a neural network's parameters using a loss function to learn complex features. Beyond training, examining the loss function with respect to a network's parameters (i.e., as a loss landscape) can reveal insights into the architecture and learning process. While the local structure of the loss landscape surrounding an individual solution can be characterized using a variety of approaches, the global structure of a loss landscape, which includes potentially many local minima corresponding to different solutions, remains far more difficult to conceptualize and visualize. To address this difficulty, we introduce LossLens, a visual analytics framework that explores loss landscapes at multiple scales. LossLens integrates metrics from global and local scales into a comprehensive visual representation, enhancing model diagnostics. We demonstrate LossLens through two case studies: visualizing how residual connections inf luence a ResNet-20, and visualizing how physical parameters influence a physics-informed neural network (PINN) solving a simple convection problem.</p>

[<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.12136?">PDF</a>]</p>
      <p>Abstract: In machine learning, a loss function measures the difference between model predictions and ground-truth (or target) values. For neural network models, visualizing how this loss changes as model parameters are varied can provide insights into the local structure of the so-called loss landscape (e.g., smoothness) as well as global properties of the underlying model (e.g., generalization performance). While various methods for visualizing the loss landscape have been proposed, many approaches limit sampling to just one or two directions, ignoring potentially relevant information in this extremely high-dimensional space. This paper introduces a new representation based on topological data analysis that enables the visualization of higher-dimensional loss landscapes. After describing this new topological landscape profile representation, we show how the shape of loss landscapes can reveal new details about model performance and learning dynamics, highlighting several use cases, including image segmentation (e.g., UNet) and scientific machine learning (e.g., physics-informed neural networks). Through these examples, we provide new insights into how loss landscapes vary across distinct hyperparameter spaces: we find that the topology of the loss landscape is simpler for better-performing models; and we observe greater variation in the shape of loss landscapes near transitions from low to high model performance.</p>

[<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.09807">PDF</a>]</p>
      <p>Abstract: Characterizing the loss of a neural network with respect to model parameters, i.e., the loss landscape, can provide valuable insights into properties of that model. Various methods for visualizing loss landscapes have been proposed, but less emphasis has been placed on quantifying and extracting actionable and reproducible insights from these complex representations. Inspired by powerful tools from topological data analysis (TDA) for summarizing the structure of high-dimensional data, here we characterize the underlying shape (or topology) of loss landscapes, quantifying the topology to reveal new insights about neural networks. To relate our f indings to the machine learning (ML) literature, we compute simple performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, error), and we characterize the local structure of loss landscapes using Hessian-based metrics (e.g., largest eigenvalue, trace, eigenvalue spectral density). Following this approach, we study established models from image pattern recognition (e.g., ResNets) and scientific ML (e.g., physics-informed neural networks), and we show how quantifying the shape of loss landscapes can provide new insights into model performance and learning dynamics.</p>

      <p>Abstract: There are significant benefits to serve deep learning models from relational databases. First, features extracted from databases do not need to be transferred to any decoupled deep learning systems for inferences, and thus the system management overhead can be significantly reduced. Second, in a relational database, data management along the storage hierarchy is fully integrated with query processing, and thus it can continue model serving even if the working set size exceeds the available memory. Applying model deduplication can greatly reduce the storage space, memory footprint, cache misses, and inference latency. However, existing data deduplication techniques are not applicable to the deep learning model serving applications in relational databases. They do not consider the impacts on model inference accuracy as well as the inconsistency between tensor blocks and database pages. This work proposed synergistic storage optimization techniques for duplication detection, page packing, and caching, to enhance database systems for model serving. We implemented the proposed approach in netsDB, an object-oriented relational database. Evaluation results show that our proposed techniques significantly improved the storage efficiency and the model inference latency, and serving models from relational databases outperformed existing deep learning frameworks when the working set size exceeds available memory.</p>
